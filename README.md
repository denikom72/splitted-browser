# splitted-browser
Simplified version of a browser with a splitted view, programmed in Java.

Adapt the eclipse IDE to run java8 and set paths to javafx-libs, before compiling.
An ant or gradle-build-script will comming soon, but the project has not so many dependencies.


A video-presentation of a splitted-browser-version with some more features ( resizable views,logins into more eMail-accounts,... ) you get [here](http://www.green-homepages.de/#chess)

P.S - It calls chess, cause my son was playing online-chess with two opponents same-timely and he use the splitted view of my browser for this purpose. So, the end of the url-string "#chess "has just some history-reasons, it doesn't explain the real meaning of this project :-).
