# splitted-browser
Simplified version of a browser with a splitted view, programmed in Java.

Adapt the eclipse IDE to run java8 and set paths to javafx-libs, before run the javac-compiler.
An ant or gradle-build-script will comming soon, but the project has not so many dependencies.

A video-presentation of a splitted-browser-version with some more features ( resizable views,logins into more eMail-accounts,... ) you get [here](http://www.green-homepages.de/#chess)
